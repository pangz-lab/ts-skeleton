# Typescript Skeleton
This repo provides the bare minimum quick-start files to effectively create and publish a typescript library.<br>
This template is for everyone to use and customize.

## Why?
Typescript and NodeJS has been around for some time but despite this fact, it's surprising there is no standard in creating a typescript library.
It's a bit cumbersome to start a project especially if you are a beginner who wants to develop and publish but cannot find a simpler and easy way to do it.
<br>
<br>
Without a standard template, you might find yourself installing/uninstalling libraries or modules wasting so much time and effort experimenting.
<br>
<br>
This template helps to solve that problem.
<br>
<br>
By following a few simple steps, you can create your own publishable library in a minute.

## üìë Requirements
- `node`- `latest`
- `npm`- `latest`
- `npm` ***account***  ( create only when you are ready to publish )

> There are no other hard requirements apart from publishing a library. Publishing requires an account. Currently, this supports `npm` only.  Although there are other package manager like yarn and others that can be used for publishing, `npm` is the easiest and fastest method in this game. You can check the official [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-the-public-npm-registry) or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/publishing-a-package/) website for more details. 
<br>
<br>

Publishing library to `npm` automatically make it available to `yarn`.

git clone https://github.com/pangz-lab/ts-skeleton.git
```

### cURL
```bash
curl -o ts-skeleton.zip https://github.com//pangz-lab/ts-skeleton/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```

### WGET
```bash

```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE <br>
> For `cURL` and `wget`, extract the zip file after the download.

# üóÇ Setup
>
> Open your favorite terminal and run the following commands.
> - [x] Make sure you're outside the project folder
> - [x] Do `ls` ( Linux or macOS ) or `dir`( Windows ) to check if you see the downloaded/extracted `ts-skeleton` folder

#### Linux & macOS
```bash
chmod +x ./ts-skeleton/tsk
NEW_LIB_NAME=new-name && mv ts-skeleton $NEW_LIB_NAME && cd $NEW_LIB_NAME && ./tsk --init && rm -rf .git
```

#### Windows 
```cmd
set NEW_LIB_NAME=new-name
move ts-skeleton %NEW_LIB_NAME% && cd %NEW_LIB_NAME% && tsk.cmd --init && rmdir /s /q .git
```

# How to start?
Follow the development flow below. There are check-points/notes on each section to serve as a guide however
as you progress, you'll find yourself skipping most of it - which is OK generally.

### Optional Step
Initialize git. [see here](https://cli.github.com/) for details.
```bash
git init
```

## üíª Development
- [x] Start your library
- [x] Code changes are reloaded automatically. Thanks to [`nodemon`](https://nodemon.io/).
```bash
./tsk --dev
```
- [x] Ceate a base class and a test class.
```bash
./tsk --create-class YourClass
```

## ‚úÖ Testing
- [x] Test your library.
- [x] [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/) is used as the main testing framework.
```bash
./tsk --test
```

## üì§ Publishing
Check the following before publishing.
- [x] Make sure you created your `npm` [account](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-new-npm-user-account).
- [x] You need to login first in `npm` thru CLI during the first run. You can use `npm login`.
- [x] Check your `package.json` and update the keys accordingly. Check the values of the common keys like
 <br>`version`, `description`, `keywords`, `dependencies`,`homepage`, `bugs` and others. [See here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json) for details.
- [x] Each publish requires a new version. Increment the `version` as needed.
- [x] Document your library. Check and update the `TODOs` marker in `README.md`.
- [x] Check and update the license.

```bash
./tsk --publish
```

## "tsk" Script
- ***tsk*** is a utility script to help automate common tasks during the development.
- It's a simple wrapper of existing `npm` commands and others shell commands.
- Use it to do your stuff quickly like creating a class or publishing them.
## Usage
> Open a terminal and run the following command.
```bash
./tsk --help
```
### Flags
| Name   |  Usage |
|:-----|:--------|
| `--help` | show available flags |
| `--init` | you only need this when initializing your project. This is called automatically during the setup |
| `--create-class` | create class and a test class. i.e. - `./tsk --create-class ClassName`|
| `--test` | run the tests. i.e. - `./tsk --test` or `./tsk --test ClassName` for specific files/class|
| `--dev` | run the library in dev mode with autoreload for updates |
| `--build` | builds the library. Transpiled code is generated to `dist` folder|
| `--publish` | publish the library to npm|
